        <h6 class="m-w-80 header_under_para">WHY CHICAGO GRIT?</h6>
        <p class="m-w-80 para_on_bottom">After 11 years of racing under former name – Intelligentsia Cup – we wanted a new name that reflects the spirit of our riders who are badass and full-send, as well as the communities in which we are fortunate to race. We knew Chicago had to be in the name, and we liked the word Grit – because that’s 
            what you need to race 10 days of full-send criteriums on technical courses.</p>
